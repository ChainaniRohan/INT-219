                        <p>The food and beverage service is part of the service-oriented hospitality sector. It can be a part of a large hotel or tourism business and it can also be run as an independent business. The members of the F&B Services team are required to perform a wide range of tasks which include preparation for service, greeting the guests, taking their orders, settling the bills, and performing various other tasks after the guests leave.</p>

                        <p>We just checked the hotel for refreshment purpose i.e. 6hr only in the morning & before starts for Paro, bhutan.

                            Rooms are clean, specious though bathrooms are small. Front desk staffs are very helpful but the other staff are not..
                            
                            Food is overpriced. Location of the hotel is just 10min (walking distance) away from Bhutan gate.

                        <p>Everything you do must reflect luxury, says Frank Schuetzendorf, who was previously the F&B Director at the Hôtel Plaza Athénée in Paris. You’re not compromising or cost cutting. A level of investment is required to deliver the quality and service, the experiences expected with luxury. It’s about doing things right, the attention to detail, following through on everything.</p>

                        <p>Lacking investment, many lost their luster. But, as societies have become wealthier and the “luxury” client evolved and fragmented – culturally, geographically and demographically – it has reawakened the luxury hotel industry. The result: extensive investment and renovation of luxury hotels.</p>
